# JSON-TF

This is the playground for the JSON Task Force.  Seeking to make JSON a first class citizen in PESC and A4L specifications.

## GETTING STARTED

### Install Node and NPM

[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) are required to run file conversions and tests.

Install dependencies with:

```Bash
$ npm install
npm notice created a lockfile as package-lock.json. You should commit this file.
npm WARN grunt-execute@0.2.2 requires a peer of grunt@~0.4.1 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.

added 20 packages from 451 contributors in 3.392s
```

And then install the Grunt command line:

```Bash
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
C:\Users\jon.nicholson.ZINETHQ\AppData\Roaming\npm\grunt -> C:\Users\jon.nicholson.ZINETHQ\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\grunt-cli\bin\grunt
+ grunt-cli@1.2.0
updated 2 packages in 1.558s
```

### Run Conversions

```Bash
$ grunt
Running "execute:target" (execute) task
-> executing C:\dev\repos\other\JSON-TF\index.js

-> completed C:\dev\repos\other\JSON-TF\index.js (554ms)

>> 1 file and 0 calls executed (571ms)

Done.
```

### Run Tests

```Bash
$ npm test

> json-tf@1.0.0 test /Users/sallen/Projects/Demo/JSON-TF
> mocha

  xStudentsGoessner.json
    #familyName
      âœ“ should find "Lovell" as familyName using xStudentsGoessner.xStudents.xStudent.name.familyName
